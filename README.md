## OOPS

Basic OOP Concepts:
1. What are the four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming?

   Ans : The four main pillars of OOPS are:
      1. Encapsulation : The wrapping up of data and functions in a single unit called class.
         - Data Hiding : Use private access modifiers to restrict the access of data from outside the class.
      2. Abstraction : Hiding the unnecessary details and providing only essential information.
         - Data Binding : Binding up of application UI and business logic. Any changes made in business logic will be directly reflected in application UI.
      3. Inheritance : The process in which an object aquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically.
         - reusability
      4. Polymorphism : The ability of objects to take on different forms or behave in different ways depending on the context in which they are used.
         - function overloading and operator overloading

2. Can you explain the concept of a class and an object?

   Ans : Class is a blueprint or prototype used for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods for the objects. It does not occupy any memory space till an object is instantiated.
   An object is an instance of class. It is a run time entity.
